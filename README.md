## Description

<a name="description"></a>

Play the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a friend! Take turns placing your symbols (X or O) on the 3x3 grid. The game indicates whose turn it is and announces the winner when a player gets three in a row, column, or diagonal. If there's a tie, it's acknowledged. Your wins are tracked using sessionStorage.
